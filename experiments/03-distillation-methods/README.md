# Behavior Distillation Methods

## Objectives
- Generate traces from agentic (L3) processes
- Cluster and identify common patterns
- Distill to more reliable L0/L2 workflows

## Experiments
- `trace_generation.py` - Log execution traces
- `pattern_clustering.py` - Identify common workflows
- `distilled_workflows.py` - Fixed implementations from patterns

## Results
Accuracy/cost/reliability tradeoffs in `results/`
